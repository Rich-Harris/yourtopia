    	Yourtopia sums up human development according to your criteria. In a short quiz you choose how important different dimensions of development are to you, and the application calculates how countries do overall, according to your priorities.

Your personal measure of social progress calculated by Yourtopia makes tracking developments easy by combining large datasets into a single index. 

With your anonymised quiz data you furthermore participate in constructing the world's first multiple-dimension index of human development that overcomes the problem of arbitrary indicator-weighting and proxy choices through open public voting.

Yourtopia is an Open Economics project by the Open Knowledge Foundation (OKFN)
