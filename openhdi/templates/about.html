          Yourtopia sums up human development according to your criteria. In a short quiz you choose how important different dimensions of development are to you, and the application calculates how countries do overall, according to your priorities.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Your personal measure of social progress calculated by Yourtopia makes tracking developments easy by combining large datasets into a single index. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With your anonymised quiz data you furthermore participate in constructing the world's first multiple-dimension index of human development that overcomes the problem of arbitrary indicator-weighting and proxy choices through open public voting.
        </p>
